        <h2 class="sub-heading">Video and Drone</h2>
        <p class="post-text">While the industry has set its sights on using the term “drone”, these devices are truly just another domain of uncrewed or robotic systems being deployed by industrial users. And often they’re the first adopted, as drones tend to be relatively affordable and mature in their capabilities.

            We’ve seen a few industry leaders slowly crossing the boundaries between the drone and growing industrial robotics sector. This includes DroneDeploy’s acquisition of Rocos, a software platform for ground robots like Spot. Boston Dynamics themselves have hired several high-profile drone professionals and partnered with several drone resellers to bring Spot to market. Not to mention that while these resellers primarily sell drones today, names such as “Rocky Mountain Unmanned Solutions” (or RMUS) suggest they intend to have a broader role as other systems mature.
            
            As larger enterprises automate more of their operations, they’ll need an array of robots across a variety of capabilities, form factors and domains. This opens an opportunity for OEMs, developers, service providers and resellers in the sUAS space to extend into other uncrewed domains.
            
            But exactly how large is this overlap in the first place, and what types of other systems are these users adopting or testing out?</p>
        <p class="post-text">Through our larger efforts to uncover the drone industry trends, we surveyed over 1,000 business and agencies with active drone programs to identify adoption trends. One of the most interesting questions we added this year was around the purchase (or future intent to purchase) of other robotic or uncrewed systems over the past 12 months.

            The findings show that while the majority (61%) of drone programs haven’t made the jump to other robotic systems, 22% have plans to and 17% have already purchased one (or more) type of robotic system.</p>
        <p class="post-text">While this is a low portion overall, considering the relative immaturity of other uncrewed systems, it signifies a likely overlap between the drone and future industrial robotics industry as they grow. </p>
        <p class="post-text">When we look just at those that purchased such systems, we find these purchases are overwhelmingly dominated by ground-based systems (82%) with most choosing a quadruped system such as the high profile Boston Dynamics Spot.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Other ground-based imaging systems include systems such as the snakebot, while maritime systems include devices such as unmanned sonar boats, rovers and more. Some notable systems among the “other systems” that respondents wrote in included TinySurveyor, various indoor laser guided vehicles (LGVs for short, mostly for warehouses), and more.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Video and Drone</h2>
        <p class="post-text">Among business and agencies with drone programs, we found huge gaps among those types of entities likely to adopt uncrewed systems and those that aren’t. When splitting behavior across key industrial sectors – energy & utilities, agriculture, AEC and surveying, public safety and real estate/insurance – we found intention to purchase other uncrewed systems ranged from as high as 63% among energy & utilities companies to just 8% among real estate and insurance firms.

            This makes sense considering the economics behind use cases in each of these industries. </p>
        <p class="post-text">One of the notable surprises here is Agriculture, an industry that had high expectations for adopting drones earlier on, but has lagged behind in adoption across North America and Europe. This likely follows differences in geography, where a ground system may be preferred across expansive yet primarily flat land.</p>
